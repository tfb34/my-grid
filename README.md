<h3>How does it work?</h3>
  mygrid is a 12-column grid, which means that in any given row you want the columns to add up to 12 or less. You can also offset your columns with the 'column-offset-1' class, which offsets your columns by 1 column in this case. If you want padding around your content add the container class to the element that wraps the content.
